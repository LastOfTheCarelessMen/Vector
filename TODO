Switch V+, V-, V*, and V/ to +, -, *, and /. (Waiting on Rakudobug to make
this work.)

Add some form of [] operator to Vector to allow easy access to the coordinate
values.  (This may also be a Rakudobug?)

Add author info to README.

Get Vector ready to work with proto.

Convince masak to add it to proto's list of packages.
