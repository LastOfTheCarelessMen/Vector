This is a simple attempt to create a working Vector class. I initially set out
to support 3D vectors, but it turned out to be easier to support vectors of
any dimension.

Test.pm is borrowed from Rakudo, as it is easiest to have a local copy.

Thanks to code from masak and mberends, Vector now has a configuration system.
To set things up:

   PERL6LIB=$PERL6LIB:lib ./Configure  # May need to run via your Perl 6 
									   # installation, if just plain #!perl6 
									   # doesn't work
   make
   make test
