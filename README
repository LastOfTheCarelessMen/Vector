This is a simple attempt to create a working Vector class. I initially set out
to support 3D vectors, but it turned out to be easier to support vectors of
any dimension.

Vector requires Rakudo from 8/28/2009 or later.

Configure.pm is borrowed from proto, as it is easiest to have a local copy for
now. Thanks to code from masak and mberends, Vector now has a configuration
system. To set things up:

	cd Vector
   	PERL6LIB=$PERL6LIB:lib ./Configure  # May need to run via your Perl 6 
	 								    # installation, if just plain #!perl6 
									    # doesn't work
   	make
    make test
