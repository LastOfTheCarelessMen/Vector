This is a simple attempt to create a working Vector class. I initially set out
to support 3D vectors, but it turned out to be easier to support vectors of
any dimension.

Test.pm is borrowed from Rakudo, as it is easiest to have a local copy.

There's no configure or makefile yet, but you can run the tests by simply
issuing

    prove -e <your_perl6_executable> -v t/01-basics.t
